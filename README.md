An (unfinished) MonoTouch binding for CocoaLibSpotify

## Notes

- It is recommended to build this yourself using the latest version of the cocoaLibSpotify library
- You can, of course, just download the .dll and add it to your project
- This is in production in my app, GroovePond, on the App Store.
- Not all the library is bound due to time constraints. Please feel free to contribute



## Requirements

- MonoTouch
- Attribution isn't required, but would be nice.
